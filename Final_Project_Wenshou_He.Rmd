```

### Doublet Detection: Discussion

To identify optimal `pK` values for DoubletFinder, I computed the BCmetric across a range of neighborhood sizes for each sample. The resulting BCmetric vs. pK plots are shown below.

Each plot identifies the `pK` that yields the strongest bimodal separation between predicted doublets and singlets. For example, **Case1_YF** shows a sharp peak, suggesting strong resolution between artificial and real doublets. In contrast, **Case2_ZY** exhibits a flatter profile, indicating that multiple `pK` values may perform similarly.

## Filtering Thresholds
```{r}
# Apply thresholds
filtered <- subset(combined, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 8000 & nCount_RNA < 75000 & percent.mt < 20)

# Compare Before and After Filtering
qc_table <- data.frame(
  Stage = c("Before Filtering", "After Filtering"),
  Cells = c(ncol(combined), ncol(filtered)),
  Genes = c(nrow(combined), nrow(filtered))
)
knitr::kable(qc_table, caption = "Number of cells and genes before and after filtering")
```

### QC: Number of Cells and Genes Before and After Filtering

| Stage            | Cells  | Genes  |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| Before Filtering | 81,939 | 25,870 |
| After Filtering  | 60,246 | 25,870 |

### QC: Discussion

To remove low-quality cells and technical artifacts, I applied quality control (QC) filtering based on three key metrics: number of detected genes per cell (`nFeature_RNA`), total transcript counts (`nCount_RNA`), and the percentage of mitochondrial gene expression (`percent.mt`).  
Cells were retained if they satisfied all of the following thresholds:

- **nFeature_RNA > 200 and < 8000**: to exclude empty droplets and likely doublets
- **nCount_RNA < 75,000**: to remove outliers with abnormally high UMI counts
- **percent.mt < 20%**: to eliminate dying or stressed cells with high mitochondrial expression

These thresholds were chosen after visual inspection of violin plots, which revealed natural cutoffs and outlier populations along each QC metric.

Before filtering, the dataset contained **81,939 cells** and **25,870 genes**. After filtering, **60,246 cells** remained, while the number of detected genes remained unchanged at **25,870**, as gene filtering was not applied in this step.

While visual inspection is a common approach for setting QC thresholds, there are more systematic alternatives described in the literature. For example:

- **miQC** ([Andrews & Hemberg, 2022](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02609-8)) models the joint distribution of mitochondrial content and gene complexity to assign quality scores probabilistically.
- **EmptyDrops** ([Lun et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0059-2)) provides a statistical method to distinguish cells from ambient RNA-containing droplets.
- **scater** and **scran** packages support data-driven outlier detection based on median absolute deviation (MAD) or PCA-based QC.

# 4. Count Normalization
```{r}
# 4. Normalize data using LogNormalize
filtered <- NormalizeData(filtered, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)
```

### Count Normalization: Discussion

The dataset was normalized using Seuratâ€™s LogNormalize method, which normalizes gene expression for each cell by the total expression, multiplies by a scale factor (10,000), and performs log-transformation. This approach helps mitigate library size differences across cells and is standard for scRNA-seq data preprocessing.

# 5. Feature Selection
```{r}
# 5. Feature Selection
# Identify 2000 highly variable features
filtered <- FindVariableFeatures(filtered, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)

# Visualize the top variable genes

vfp_labeled <- LabelPoints(plot = vfp, points = head(VariableFeatures(filtered), 10), repel = TRUE)

ggsave("plots/hvg_selection.png", vfp_labeled, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

### Highly Variable Gene Selection
<img src="plots/hvg_selection.png" width="600"/>

### Feature Selection: Discussion

To reduce noise and focus on informative genes, I selected 2,000 highly variable genes using the vst method, which models mean-variance dependence across all genes.

From a total of 21,640 expressed genes (non-NA), 2,000 (\~9.2%) were retained as highly variable for use in PCA and clustering. These include known marker genes such as SPP1, IGHA1, and MGP.

Genes with low average expression and low standardized variance were excluded, as they contribute less to cell-to-cell variability.

The resulting plot (shown above) displays average expression (x-axis, log10 scale) vs standardized variance (y-axis), where red points indicate selected highly variable genes.

# 6. PCA
```{r}
# 6. PCA
# Scale data and perform PCA using the top 2000 variable genes

filtered <- RunPCA(filtered, features = VariableFeatures(filtered), npcs = 50)

# View PCA results
print(filtered[["pca"]], dims = 1:5, nfeatures = 5)

# Visualize standard deviation for each PC to determine optimal number
elbow <- ElbowPlot(filtered, ndims = 50)

ggsave("plots/pca_scree.png", elbow, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

### Principal Component Standard Deviations
<img src="plots/pca_scree.png" width="600"/>

### PCA: Discussion

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using the 2,000 most highly variable genes. The ElbowPlot above shows the standard deviation of each principal component.

The plot indicates that variance contribution drops significantly after PC 10, making it a natural cutoff for downstream dimensionality reduction.

I chose the first 10 PCs for further clustering and visualization, as they likely capture the major biological signals in the data.

```

knitr::kable(as.data.frame(sample_counts), col.names = c("Sample", "Cell Count"))
```

### Clustering and Visualization: Discussion

After dimensionality reduction using PCA, clustering was performed using the graph-based Louvain algorithm on the first 10 PCs. A **resolution of 0.5** was selected, resulting in **23 transcriptionally distinct clusters**, as shown in the UMAP visualization labeled by cluster identity.

In total, **60,246 cells** passed quality control and were retained for downstream analysis. The breakdown of cell counts per sample is as follows:

| Sample     | Cell Count |
|------------|------------|
| Case1_YF   | 8,159      |
| Case1_ZY   | 8,467      |
| Case2_YF   | 11,337     |
| Case2_ZC   | 6,398      |
| Case2_ZY   | 9,094      |
| Case3_YF   | 7,899      |
| Case3_ZY   | 7,486      |
| Case4_ZY   | 1,406      |

The UMAP plot colored by sample of origin revealed partial separation among certain samples, such as Case2_ZC and Case4_ZY, suggesting the presence of batch effects. While some degree of intermixing was observed among tumor samples (e.g., Case1_YF, Case2_YF, Case3_YF), the overall structure indicated that clustering might be influenced more by technical variation than biology alone, which means the integration was needed.

        label = TRUE) +

```

### UMAP After Integration by Cluster Identity
<img src="plots/umap_harmony_samples.png" width="600"/>

### Integration: Discussion
After performing batch correction using the Harmony integration method, I re-clustered the cells and visualized them using UMAP. The first plot, colored by sample group (YF, ZC, ZY), demonstrates successful integrationâ€”cells from different sample groups are now well mixed across most clusters.

The second plot, which splits the UMAP by group and labels clusters, further highlights this improvement. Most clusters are consistently represented across all three sample groups, suggesting that biological signal rather than technical noise now dominates the embedding. For instance, clusters such as 0, 3, 5, 6, 10, and 12 appear in all three groups with roughly similar shapes and locations.

In summary, integration with Harmony reduced sample-driven variance, improved clustering consistency across conditions, and provided a biologically meaningful representation of the data that supports cross-sample comparisons.

# Filter positive markers and get top 5 per cluster
top5_markers <- marker_genes %>%
  dplyr::group_by(group) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(logFC)) %>%
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 5) %>%
  dplyr::rename(cluster = group)

# Show result table
knitr::kable(
  top5_markers[, c("cluster", "feature", "logFC", "pct_in", "pct_out", "padj")],
  caption = "Top 5 Marker Genes Per Cluster"
)
```

### Marker Gene Analysis: Discussion

To identify marker genes for each cluster, I used the `presto::wilcoxauc()` function, a fast implementation of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. This method compares gene expression in each cluster versus all others to detect significantly enriched markers.

I extracted the top 5 genes per cluster based on log fold change. The resulting markers include well-known cell type indicators such as **IL7R**, **SPP1**, **TFF1**, **KRT19**, and **HLA-DRA**, confirming that clusters reflect meaningful biological populations.

**Advantages** of this method:
- Extremely fast on large datasets.
- Statistically rigorous with adjusted p-values.
- Easily interpretable outputs.

**Limitations**:
- Does not handle compositional effects or covariates.
- Sensitive to sparse gene expression for small clusters.

### Cell Type Annotation by SingleR
<img src="plots/umap_singler_labels.png" width="600"/>

### Automatic Cell Type Annotation: Discussion

To assign preliminary cell type identities, I used the [**SingleR**](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1) algorithm, a reference-based method that performs label transfer by comparing the transcriptomic profile of each single cell with reference cell types derived from single-cell datasets. Specifically, I used the built-in **Human Primary Cell Atlas (HPCA)** reference.

SingleR works by computing correlation scores between each test cell and each reference cell type using a set of informative genes. It then assigns a label based on the **most similar reference** while performing fine-tuning to improve robustness across noisy or ambiguous profiles

The resulting UMAP (shown above) reveals a broad diversity of cell types across the 60,246 cells in the dataset. Key identities include:

- **Immune cells** such as **T cells**, **NK cells**, **Monocytes**, **Macrophages**, **B cells**, and **Dendritic cells (DC)**, mostly localized to the upper and right-hand regions of the UMAP.  
- **Progenitor populations** such as **HSC_CD34+**, **Pro-B cells**, and **Erythroblasts**, consistent with the presence of hematopoietic elements.
- **Epithelial** and **Keratinocyte** clusters on the left, alongside **Neuroepithelial cells**, **Fibroblasts**, and **Smooth muscle cells**, suggesting mesenchymal and epithelial diversity.
- **Stem-like populations** including **Tissue stem cells**, **iPS cells**, and **MSC**, indicate residual developmental signatures or plasticity in the samples.

The variety of cell identities likely reflects contributions from **multiple tissue sources**, especially considering this dataset includes **primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors**, **liver metastases**, and **adjacent normal tissues**. For example:

- **T/NK cells**, **Monocytes**, and **Macrophages** are common components of the **tumor immune microenvironment**.
- **Fibroblasts**, **Smooth muscle cells**, and **Endothelial cells** are hallmarks of **stromal activation**.
- **Epithelial cells**, particularly **Keratinocytes** and **Hepatocytes**, may derive from **normal adjacent tissues** or residual contamination.

### Manual Cluster Labeling: Discussion

To finalize cell type identities, I manually assigned labels to each cluster based on a combination of top marker genes identified using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and the automatic annotations from SingleR. Marker gene literature and canonical cell type markers were referenced to guide the process. For example, **Cluster 0** expressed high levels of *IL7R*, *CXCR4*, and *TSC22D3*, consistent with **naive T cells** [Zheng et al., 2017]. **Cluster 1**, enriched in *TFF1*, *TFF3*, and *MUC1*, was labeled as **mucosal epithelial cells**, a subtype often observed in digestive and pancreatic tissue [Rogers et al., 2004]. **Cluster 2** showed strong expression of cytotoxic genes such as *CCL5*, *GNLY*, and *GZMA*, and was annotated as **cytotoxic T/NK cells**.

Clusters with strong expression of *APOE*, *SPP1*, and *HLA-DRA* (e.g., Clusters 3 and 21) were assigned as **macrophages** and **tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)** respectively, following macrophage profiling in tumor microenvironments [Qian & Pollard, 2010]. Stromal and fibroblast populations (Clusters 4, 15, and 24) were identified based on collagen gene signatures like *COL1A1* and *LUM*. B cells (Cluster 17) and plasma cells (Cluster 18) were labeled using *MS4A1*, *IGKC*, and *JCHAIN*. Endothelial cells (Cluster 16) were identified via *A2M* and *HSPG2* expression.

Each assignment was cross-validated using known biological functions and expression profiles documented in cell atlases and original studies [Zheng et al., 2017; Qian & Pollard, 2010]. The resulting labels provide a biologically interpretable view of cell populations across primary tumor, metastatic, and normal samples.

### Cell Type Proportions Across Samples
<img src="plots/cell_proportion_plot.png" width="800"/>

**Discussion:**  
To quantify cell composition variability across samples, I computed the relative proportions of manually annotated cell types per sample. The stacked barplot highlights substantial differences. For instance, Case2_ZC (a liver metastasis) shows a dominance of fibroblasts, myeloid-derived cells, and TAMs, while Case1_YF and Case2_YF (primary tumors) are enriched for T cells and epithelial subtypes.

These trends are consistent with the biological context: metastatic lesions often show increased stromal and inflammatory cell infiltration, whereas primary tumors may retain a more structured epithelial signature. The inter-patient diversity in TAMs, plasma cells, and ductal epithelial content reflects immune heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment plasticity, mirroring key conclusions from the original publication (*Zhang et al., 2023*).

### CellChat Bubble Plot: TAMs Signaling to Tumor Epithelium
<img src="plots/cellchat_TAM_to_epithelial.png" width="800"/>

**Discussion:**  
To explore the intercellular signaling dynamics in the tumor microenvironment, I used the **CellChat** framework to infer **ligandâ€“receptor interactions** between **tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)** and epithelial-derived clusters (**Tumor Epithelium** and **Epithelial Secretory**). Focusing on three key signaling pathwaysâ€”**TGF-Î²**, **MIF**, and **TNF**â€”the bubble plot shows that **MIFâ€“(CD74+CD44)** interactions dominate communication from TAMs to Epithelial Secretory cells. This suggests active engagement of **immunomodulatory crosstalk** that may promote **tumor growth** and **immune evasion**.

Additional interactions, including **TGF-Î²1â€“(ACVR1B+TGFBR2)** and **TNFâ€“TNFRSF1A**, were also identified, indicating **broader paracrine signaling**. These findings replicate core results from the original study, which identified TAMs as major communicators in the **PDAC microenvironment** through **pro-tumor signaling networks**. Our results are consistent with prior literature showing that **MIF-mediated signaling** plays a key role in promoting **tumor progression** and **epithelial plasticity** (*He et al., 2021*).

### Additional Analysis: Pseudotime Inference Using Slingshot

To further investigate the potential developmental dynamics or activation transitions within the tumor microenvironment, I performed **pseudotime trajectory inference** using the `slingshot` algorithm. Unlike the original study (Zhang et al., 2023), which focused primarily on compositional and signaling differences, pseudotime analysis provides insights into **continuous cell-state transitions**, such as macrophage polarization or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT).

Instead of using UMAP (which can distort global structure), I extracted the first two **principal components (PC1 and PC2)** from the integrated dataset as the low-dimensional space for trajectory inference. Clusters manually annotated via marker genes served as the **starting labels** for lineage detection.

As shown in the figure below:

<img src="plots/pseudotime_slingshot_PCA.png" width="800"/>

A major trajectory is observed progressing along PC2, suggesting a **continuous transition among a subset of cells**, potentially reflecting phenotypic plasticity or activation gradients. The smooth progression of pseudotime values (from blue to yellow) supports the existence of dynamic transcriptional programs, likely driven by **TME (tumor microenvironment) cues** or **metastatic adaptation**.

This result echoes findings from other studies that identified gradual TAM polarization and epithelial plasticity in pancreatic cancer and liver metastasis models (*Li et al., 2022, Orecchioni et al., 2019*). Further dissection of gene expression along this pseudotime axis could reveal regulatory factors associated with pro-tumor or immunosuppressive programs.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Pseudotime analysis reveals a potential **trajectory of transcriptional change** within the dataset, providing a dynamic view of cell fate or state transitions that complements the static cluster annotations and signaling interactions.
